# CSGOBot

This is the repository for my Counter Strike bot. It watches Counter Strike matches and can determine the winner of each round.
The score is update to a website for live reporting of scores in a match.

## TODO

1.  More intelligent side switching

2.  Determining which team starts which side

3.  More robust round win decision
      - more redundancies for side wins
      - quicker checks?

4.  There may be an issue with named teams
      
5.  Implementation for a dynamic web page
      - javascript web ui
      - need a place to host it
    
6.  Automated runtime
      - how will a server run this? Can a (headless)server run this?
      - my computer runs job, has file available to server
